Imports
signatures for fields, methods, and locals
return comments should have a semi-colon before them
moveexception
calling own constructor should be "this", calling super constructor should be "super"
    don't write super constructor call if default (old style sig is same)
make sure invoke-super works properly
All non-java stuffs should be commented - e.g. comment out catch, catchall
don't print anything synthetic
don't print anything for nop


done:
return types should be short
field types should be short
proper constructor names (definitions)
    [x] don't say constructor
    [x] don't put return type
    [x] put class name instead of <init>
parameter types should be short
return register problem - non printing statements' left side should be raw register number
deal with new instance/initialization issue
remove unnecessary this on non-static invocation
string literals not parsed correctly
deal with method calls and moving result

Later:
synthetic method resolution
optimise move -> typecast? only problem with local
inner class resolution
enums
packed and sparse switches
tries
monitor/sync
goto resolution
